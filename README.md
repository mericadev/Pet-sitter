## Overview

### The challenge

The website in its original state lacked engaging content and visual appeal. It suffered from a plain and uninteresting design, with no hover effects on navigation links and buttons. As a result, it failed to capture the attention of users and provide an enjoyable browsing experience. The challenge was to revamp the website to make it more visually appealing and engaging for visitors.

## My process

In approaching the redesign, I prioritized enhancing the visual aesthetics and user experience of the website. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on implementing dynamic hover effects for navigation links and buttons to create a more interactive and engaging interface.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the importance of incorporating interactive elements, such as hover effects, to enhance the overall user experience. I also honed my skills in JavaScript for dynamically loading the navbar and footer, contributing to a more seamless and efficient website navigation system.


### Continued development

Moving forward, there is room for further development to enrich the website's content and features. This could include adding more engaging multimedia elements, refining the design aesthetics, and optimizing performance for various devices and browsers.
